# intenion-flow-in-us-lobby-network

*remember that lobby could have two distrinct objectives: 1) regulatory captrue(changing the law) 2) infomrational lobby (to acquire congressional information)

## Goal
We define the anomalies as two types - one is structural change, the other one is weight change. Actors participating in US lobby network basically has its own intention. Those intentions are realized by flow the money to the other actors and those flow actually constitute the how to intentions are flowing in the network.

Our approch is to spot those intention in dynamically changing US lobby network. By spotting differences from the previous phase of the lobby network, we spot the intentions that were not observables to us, and with a help of political experts, we will interpret those changes to understand the current political situation.

"Working with a husband-and-wife team of Washington lobbyists, [Ameriquest
Mortgage Co.] handed out more than $20 million in political donations and played a
big role in persuading legislators in New Jersey and Georgia to relax tough new laws.
[…] Ameriquest became a player in the business of lending to low-income
homeowners. The company persuaded many homeowners to take cash out of their
houses by refinancing them for larger amounts than their existing mortgages. […]
Home loans made by Ameriquest and other subprime lenders are defaulting now in
large numbers." - [Glenn Simpson, “Lender Lobbying Blitz Abetted Mortgage Mess,” Wall Street Journal, December 31, 2007](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119906606162358773)
