# intenion-flow-in-us-lobby-network

## Goal
We define the anomalies as two types - one is structural change, the other one is weight change. Actors participating in US lobby network basically has its own intention. Those intentions are realized by flow the money to the other actors and those flow actually constitute the how to intentions are flowing in the network.

Our approch is to spot those intention in dynamically changing US lobby network. By spotting differences from the previous phase of the lobby network, we spot the intentions that were not observables to us, and with a help of political experts, we will interpret those changes to understand the current political situation.
