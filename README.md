# intenion-flow-in-us-lobby-network

*remember that lobby could have two distrinct objectives: 1) regulatory captrue(changing the law) 2) infomrational lobby (to acquire congressional information)

**concept of regulatory capture, firstly introduced in Stigler (1972),

## Goal
We define the anomalies as two types - one is structural change, the other one is weight change. Actors participating in US lobby network basically has its own intention. Those intentions are realized by flow the money to the other actors and those flow actually constitute the how to intentions are flowing in the network.

Our approch is to spot those intention in dynamically changing US lobby network. By spotting differences from the previous phase of the lobby network, we spot the intentions that were not observables to us, and with a help of political experts, we will interpret those changes to understand the current political situation.

#### The Beginning: Eases Regulation On Subprime Mortgage
"Working with a husband-and-wife team of Washington lobbyists, [Ameriquest
Mortgage Co.] handed out more than $20 million in political donations and played a
big role in persuading legislators in New Jersey and Georgia to relax tough new laws.
[…] Ameriquest became a player in the business of lending to low-income
homeowners. The company persuaded many homeowners to take cash out of their
houses by refinancing them for larger amounts than their existing mortgages. […]
Home loans made by Ameriquest and other subprime lenders are defaulting now in
large numbers." - [Glenn Simpson, “Lender Lobbying Blitz Abetted Mortgage Mess,” Wall Street Journal, December 31, 2007](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119906606162358773)

#### After Crisis Hit: The Golden Tab - Who's gonna be Bailed Out? : TARP
Troubled OneUnited Bank in Boston didn’t look much like a candidate for aid from the
Treasury Department’s bank bailout fund last fall. […] Nonetheless, in December
OneUnited got a $12 million injection from the Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief
Program, or TARP. One apparent factor: the intercession of Rep. Barney Frank, the
powerful head of the House Financial Services Committee. […] Some powerful
politicians have used their leverage to try to direct federal millions toward banks in
their home states. “It’s totally arbitrary,” says South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford. “If
you’ve got the right lobbyist and the right representative connected to Washington or
the right ties to Washington, you get the golden tap on the shoulder. - [9 Damian Paletta and David Enrich, “Political Interference Seen in Bank Bailout Decisions,” Wall Street Journal, January 22, 2009.]()

They construct a dataset combining information on banks’ lobbying and mortgage lending activities and ask whether lobbying lenders behaved differently from nonlobbying lenders in the 2000–2007 period and how they performed in 2008

#### The Aftermath: Still the Banks Are Lobbying After 2008? Yes they do.
